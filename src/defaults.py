# NOTE: every token below is anchored with a leading `(?:^|.*/)` boundary
# (start-of-string OR a literal `/`). This is required because `--exclude-regex`
# matching semantics differ by frontend:
#   * JVM frontends (c2cpg, javasrc2cpg, pysrc2cpg, ...) full-match the pattern
#     (`Regex.matches`) against the path RELATIVE to the input dir.
#   * astgen frontends (jssrc2cpg, ...) run plain `RegExp.test()` — an UNANCHORED
#     substring search — against the file's ABSOLUTE path.
# Without the boundary, a bare token like `\..*` degenerates under substring
# search into "any string containing a `.`", so `index.js` (and effectively every
# real source file) gets excluded and the CPG comes out empty. The `(?:^|.*/)`
# form matches a whole path component at start-of-string or right after a `/`
# under BOTH regimes, and additionally lets root-level dirs (e.g. `vendor/`) match
# where a bare `.*/` prefix previously required a leading path segment.
